/* 
Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores (_) and dollar signs ($).
Variable names are case sensitive.
Variable names cannot start with a number.
Start your variable names with a lower case letter.
JavaScript reserved words cannot be used as variable names. We will see a list of these later.
As a convention, when a variable name contains multiple words, we separate them with upper case letters. This is called camel case. For example numberOfRooms, carColor.
